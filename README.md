Student Marks Prediction- Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project is a Machine Learning (ML) application designed to analyze student marks across various subjects and then predict marks for the remaining subjevt. The primary goal is to demonstrate how AI tools, specifically GitHub Copilot in VSCode, can streamline the development process, enabling rapid project creation with minimal effort. With a basic understanding of ML, anyone can create similar projects quickly.

Unique Selling Point
What sets this project apart is that it was entirely developed using GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool. The project highlights how AI can assist developers in writing code more efficiently, reducing the time and effort required to bring a project from concept to completion.

Features
Student Marks Analysis: Analyze student performance across different subjects using machine learning models.
Effortless AI Integration: The project was developed quickly with the help of GitHub Copilot, showcasing how AI can support and accelerate the coding process.
User-Friendly: The code is straightforward and well-documented, making it easy for anyone with a basic understanding of ML to follow and adapt.
