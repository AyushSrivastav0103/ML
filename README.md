Student Marks Analysis Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project is a Machine Learning (ML) application designed to analyze student marks across various subjects. It includes a Flask web application that allows users to input data and predict student scores in other subjects. The primary goal is to demonstrate how AI tools, specifically GitHub Copilot in VSCode, can streamline the development process, enabling rapid project creation with minimal effort. With a basic understanding of ML, anyone can create similar projects quickly.

Unique Selling Point
What sets this project apart is that it was entirely developed using GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool. The project highlights how AI can assist developers in writing code more efficiently, reducing the time and effort required to bring a project from concept to completion.

Features
Student Marks Analysis: Analyze student performance across different subjects using machine learning models.
Flask Web Application: Provides an interface to input student data and predict scores in other subjects.
Effortless AI Integration: Developed rapidly with the help of GitHub Copilot, showcasing AIâ€™s role in accelerating the development process.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-follow code and a simple web interface make it accessible for users with basic ML knowledge.
Installation
1>Clone the Repository:

2>Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and pip installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3>Run the Flask Application:
Start the Flask server by running:
python app.py
The web application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

4>Usage
Access the Web Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Input Data:
Use the web form to input student data, including marks in various subjects.

Get Predictions:
Submit the form to get predictions for student scores in other subjects.

Example
Visit the Flask web interface, input the student data (e.g., marks in current subjects), and view the predicted scores.

How AI Helped
This project was built almost entirely using GitHub Copilot in VSCode. The AI tool provided code suggestions, autocompleted functions, and even assisted with documentation. The project serves as a proof-of-concept for how AI can assist developers in creating projects quickly, with less manual effort.
